It’s built to be user-friendly, with a clean interface and real-time performance tracking. We wanted to give both new and experienced traders the kind of tooling that’s normally hidden behind complex dashboards or expensive platforms.</p><p>The idea was to make trading strategies more accessible, easier to monitor, and to bring people together through community-driven insights. The platform supports multiple strategies, offers analytics, and gives traders a way to learn from each other. That was the heart of it, build something useful for everyone, not just the experts.</p><hr><h2 id=how-it-started>How it started</h2><p>Back in June, I saw an advert for ETHCapeTown on Instagram and decided to register. At the time, I had no idea what I’d build, or if I’d even follow through with it.</p><p>A month later, I got the notification—I was accepted. But honestly, when the hackathon weekend arrived, I didn’t feel like participating. I felt alone in the Web3 space. I didn’t know anyone attending except my friend, and I wasn’t feeling up to it.</p><p>Then something unexpected happened. A friend of mine posted a WhatsApp status that he was already at the hackathon. That small thing sparked something in me. I jumped into the Discord server, read up on the details, and decided to check things out.</p><hr><h2 id=joining-the-team>Joining the team</h2><p>Friday night, I joined a team of four. We clicked pretty quickly. After a bit of brainstorming, we landed on an idea, Astranova. We reached out to the AstraBits team, who explained how their API worked, and they were incredibly supportive.</p><p>After that call, we had a debrief session as a team. We shared tasks, set up our workspace, and started building. No one wanted to sleep—we were all too invested.</p><p>I personally went to bed around 5am, and by 10am Saturday, I was back online coding. I was working remotely Friday through Saturday, but we stayed connected and kept the momentum going. Even though the project wasn’t finished, we had a strong sense that we could pull it off. Or at the very least, explain it well enough to show its potential.</p><hr><h2 id=presentation-day>Presentation day</h2><p>Sunday morning came, and we were still piecing things together. We submitted what we had, not really sure if we’d make it. Then—boom—we got selected as one of the projects to present live to the judges.</p><p>My teammates were already onsite. I quickly showered, packed my bag, and went to meet them. We met for the first time in person and spent time refining the final presentation.</p><p>When it was time, we pitched Astranova live. It wasn’t perfect, but it was honest. We shared the idea, what we had built, and why it mattered.</p><hr><h2 id=the-win>The win</h2><p>Guess what?</p><p>We won:</p><ul><li>🥇 1st Place Tooling for Mass Adoption Track</li><li>🏅 4th Place Overall</li><li>💰 $1,000 bounty from AstraBits</li></ul><p>It still feels surreal. I didn’t even want to participate at first—and now here I was, standing on stage with a team I had just met, holding a win that felt deeply earned.</p><hr><h2 id=looking-back>Looking back</h2><p>I went into ETHCapeTown wanting to improve my soft skills. I wanted to learn how to collaborate better, communicate clearly, and build something meaningful with strangers.</p><p>And it happened.</p><p>The reward wasn’t just the prize or the title—it was the experience. Learning to trust new people, solve real problems together, and push through even when things felt uncertain.</p><p>ETHCapeTown reminded me that Web3 doesn’t have to be lonely. There’s a whole world of builders out there. Sometimes all it takes is showing up, being open, and giving yourself permission to try.</p><p>Thanks for reading. 🙏</p></div></div><div class="flex flex-row justify-around my-2"><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left mr-4"><a href=/blog/web3/ title="What is Web3 and How Do Smart Contracts Work on Ethereum?"><i class="nav-menu fas fa-chevron-circle-left"></i></a></h3><h3 class="mb-1 mt-1 text-left ml-4"><i class="text-gray-300 dark:text-gray-600 fas fa-chevron-circle-right"></i></h3></div></main><footer class="text-sm text-center border-t border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 py-6"><p class=markdownify>powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a></p><p><i><a href=https://github.com/darshanbaral/aafu>aafu
